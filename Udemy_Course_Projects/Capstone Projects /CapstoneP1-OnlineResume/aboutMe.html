<h1>About Me</h1>
    <hr/>

    <p>
        Growing up, I had always been fascinated by the culinary arts. I loved the creativity and passion involved in cooking, and I was drawn to the fast-paced and dynamic environment of professional kitchens.
        At first, I envisioned myself pursuing a career as a chef. However, after gaining experience in the industry, I realized that I was more interested in the tech world. I was particularly intrigued by software development and its increasing demand.    
        This realization led me to shift my focus towards software development. I began studying the subject in my free time, and I was immediately captivated by the challenge of solving complex problems through code.
        In June 2023, I graduated from college. Since then, I have continued to pursue my budding passion for software development by taking online courses, attending meetups, and building personal projects, one of which is actually the resume you're reading right now.
        I am now eager to apply my skills and knowledge to a professional setting. I am confident that my unique blend of hospitality and technical expertise would be an asset to any team.
