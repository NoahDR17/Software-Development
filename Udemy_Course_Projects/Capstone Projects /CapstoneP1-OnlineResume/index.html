    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        Since graduating from high school at the age of 16, I have gained a variety of professional experience in part-time roles while attending college.
        Having recently turned 18 and completed my college studies, I am now seeking a full-time position that will allow me to continue my professional development and contribute to a team.
        I am confident that my diverse work experience has prepared me for a variety of roles. In my most recent position as a kitchen porter, I regularly worked 10-hour shifts with no breaks during peak periods.
        This experience has developed my resilience to hard work and my ability to handle stressful situations effectively. I have also developed strong organizational skills and the ability to manage myself and others efficiently.
        I am eager to learn and grow in a professional setting, and I am confident that I would be a valuable asset to any team.
